 case the native iOS SDK was wrapped by the Xamarin SDK. You must not * register
 an UncaughtExceptionHandler for Xamarin as we rely on the xamarin runtime to
 report NSExceptions. * Registering our own UncaughtExceptionHandler will cause
 the Xamarin debugger to not work properly: The debugger will * not stop for
 NSExceptions and it's impossible to handle them in a C# try-catch block. On
 Xamarin runtime, if we don't * register our own exception handler, the Xamarin
 runtime will catch NSExceptions and re-throw them as .Net-exceptions * which
 can be handled and are then reported by App Center Crashes properly. Just as a
 reminder: this doesn't mean * that we are not using PLCrashReporter to catch
 crashes, it just means that we disable its ability to catch * crashes caused by
 NSExceptions, only those for the reasons mentioned in this paragraph.
